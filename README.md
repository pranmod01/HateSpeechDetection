## HateSpeechDetection
# Coding exercise for Trust Labs

The sub-problems I tried to solve are:
1) Building a testing data set by extract tweets from Twitter with specific keywords, using the tweepy API 
2) Began buidling a classification model that would predict whether an input text can be classified 
3) An algorithm that would be able to process input text and classify it as "Hate Content", 
Not Hate Content", or "Neutral/unidentifiable" using the above defined model.

Since this is my first time building a (text classification/NLP) model completeley from scratch, I could not complete
the second bullet. However, I have listened some more potetional ideas at the end of my script that I thought could be implemented if I had the time.

Thanks for the oppurtunity! This was an exciting challenge and I have a lot to learn.
